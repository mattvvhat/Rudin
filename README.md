# Mathematics and Review

*"Reunion of Broken Parts"*

## About

A review of Mathematical material by Matt Hammerstadt. My life is git now.
It's probably crucial to accept that, and move forward using it to an advantage.

This work is written in LaTeX as a tool used for reflection. It probably has
more archival strength than print, and - tbh - I might actually review it (which
I wouldn't if it was in Five Stars).

## Manifest

* `/rudin` : A study using *Principles of Mathematics by Rudin*
* `/definitions` : 

## Manifesto

In addition to actually practicing my Math skills, this is also become on of my
many tools for reflection.
